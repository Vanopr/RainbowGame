The game "Rainbow" uses the well-known "Stroop Effect" in psychology: when the color of the word does not match what is written, reading it becomes more difficult.

Thanks to this effect and various game settings:

► Both brain hemispheres are activated

► Reaction speed is increased

► Attention concentration is enhanced

► Parallel processing is activated - the ability to perform multiple actions simultaneously.

All of this contributes to entering a high-performance state (HPS), where the brain starts working more efficiently, solving complex tasks much faster.

GAME RULES:

A word indicating a color appears on the screen, for example: the word "blue" is written. You need to verbally say the color of the word. For example, if the word "blue" is written in green, then we say "green" out loud.

## GAME TIME:

The usual game duration is 10-15 minutes. For most people, this time is sufficient to transition to a high-productivity state.
